# HIIT Analyzer Dash Application - Fixes Summary

## Fixes Applied

### 1. JSON Serialization Error (FIXED)
**Problem**: `TypeError: Object of type int64 is not JSON serializable`
**Solution**: 
- Added `NumpyEncoder` class to `hiit/data_io.py` to handle NumPy data types
- Updated all `json.dump()` calls to use `cls=NumpyEncoder`
- Converts `np.int64` → `int`, `np.float64` → `float`, `np.ndarray` → `list`

### 2. CSV File Support (ADDED)
**Problem**: Application only supported .fit files
**Solution**:
- Modified `load_fit_data()` in `hiit/data_io.py` to support both .fit and .csv files
- CSV files are automatically detected by file extension
- Timestamp column is converted to datetime and set as index

### 3. Data Directory Handling (IDENTIFIED)
**Issue**: The `data` directory is a symlink to `/mnt/c/Users/kevin/Dropbox/HIIT/`
**Status**: No changes needed - the app should work with symlinks

### 4. Deprecated Dash API (FIXED)
**Problem**: `app.run_server()` is deprecated in newer Dash versions
**Solution**: Changed to `app.run()` in `app_dash.py`

## Test Results

### Simple Tests (test_app_simple.py)
- ✅ JSON Serialization: PASSED
- ✅ CSV Support: PASSED  
- ✅ App Structure: PASSED (after fixing nav button detection)
- ❌ App Startup: FAILED (due to missing dependencies in test environment)

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Environment Dependencies
The application requires these Python packages to run:
- dash
- dash-bootstrap-components
- plotly
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- fitparse

**Recommendation**: Run the app in Docker or a virtual environment with all dependencies installed.

### 2. End-to-End Testing
Due to environment constraints, full Playwright E2E testing couldn't be completed. However, I've created comprehensive test files:
- `tests/test_app_e2e.py` - Full Playwright E2E tests
- `tests/test_docker_e2e.py` - Docker-based E2E tests
- `tests/test_app_simple.py` - Simple tests without external dependencies

### 3. Functional Requirements Verification
Without access to the full `functional_requirements.txt` content, I cannot verify all requirements are met. The key features that should be tested:

1. **Raw Data Analysis Page**
   - File selection dropdown
   - Data visualization plots
   - Summary statistics

2. **HIIT Interval Analysis Page**  
   - Interactive interval selection on graph (KEY FEATURE for Dash)
   - Threshold calibration slider
   - Interval detection algorithm
   - Manual window settings persistence

3. **Performance Metrics Page**
   - Cross-file analysis
   - Performance scatter plots
   - Metrics tables

4. **Data Persistence**
   - Manual window settings saved/loaded correctly
   - Correlation threshold settings persistence
   - Cache mechanism for algorithm results

## How to Run the Application

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The app will be available at http://localhost:8050

### Option 2: Local Python
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_dash.txt

# Run the app
python app_dash.py
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Start the application** using one of the methods above
2. **Open browser** to http://localhost:8050
3. **Test each page**:
   - Raw Data: Select a file, verify plots load without errors
   - Interval Analysis: Check interactive selection works on the graph
   - Performance Metrics: Verify cross-file analysis displays

4. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
5. **Test file switching** to ensure JSON serialization works
6. **Save/load manual settings** to verify persistence

## Critical Success Criteria

The main reason for switching to Dash was to enable **interactive selection of HIIT interval bounds on a graph**. This should be tested thoroughly:

1. Navigate to Interval Analysis page
2. Select a file with HIIT data
3. Click and drag on the graph to select interval bounds
4. Verify the selection is saved and persists across page reloads
5. Ensure the algorithm respects the manual bounds when detecting intervals

## Next Steps

1. Run the application with full dependencies installed
2. Execute the Playwright E2E tests (`python tests/test_app_e2e.py`)
3. Verify all functional requirements are met
4. Address any remaining errors found during testing
